<h1>QMCPACK</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
QMCPACK is the name of a Fortran 95 library for doing Quasi-Monte Carlo
related computations.  The main focus of the library is at:
<dl>
 <dt><em>Portability</em></dt>
 <dd>The library is `portable' in the sense that the source code compiles
     under a variaty of compilers and adheres to the ISO/IEC 1539-1:1997
     Fortran 95 standard.  QMCPACK is being tested on a regular basis to compile
     with the following compilers:
     <ul>
       <li><a href="http://g95.sourceforge.net/">G95</a></li>
       <li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/">GNU Fortran 95</a></li>
       <li><a href="http://www.nag.com/nagware/NP.asp">NAGWare f95 Compiler</a></li>
       <li><a href="http://www.fortran.com/F/compilers.html">Fortran Company/NAG F compiler</a></li>
       <li><a
       href="http://www.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/compilers/flin/index.htm">Intel(R) Fortran Compiler 9.0</a></li>
     </ul>
   <p>
   Although this has not been tested, any other standard-conforming compiler
   should be able to compile the code to something executable.  Feel free to
   send us your successfull attempts.
   </p>
   <p>
   As Linux is currently the main development platform for QMCPACK,
   only Makefiles for Linux are included to build the executables.
   If you however succeed in compiling QMCPACK on Windows, please let us
   know how you did it and send us the necessary files.
   <p>
 <dt><em>Ease of use</em></dt>
 <dd>Effort has been put in trying to keep the library as easy to use as
     possibly by implementing the algorithms with a clean, easy-to-use and
     intuitive interface.
 <dt><em>Correctness</em></dt>
 <dd>Several testmodules making up a kind of testsuite have been added
     so it is easy to check if certain changes break the code or not.
     </dd>
 <dt><em>Speed?</em></dt>
 <dd>In the beginning the main focus was of course on the correctness of the
 code.  In the meanwhile, I observed however that some parts of it already
 have quite good timing-results.  During the development, I therefore now not
 only stress on correctness, but also try to keep speed-issues in mind.
 Speed is however currently still not my primary focus.

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>
These things are currently as good as supported in the preliminary version
of QMCPACK:
<ul>
  <li>
    Generation of several low-discrepancy sequences, such as
    <ul>
      <li>Several radical inverse functions.</li>
      <li>Halton sequences and several scramblings of it.</li>
      <li>Sobol sequences.</li>
      <li>Faure sequences (graycode or non-graycode ordening)</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>Randomizing pointsets with the Cranley-Patterson randomization
       technique.</li>
   <li>Calculation of L<sub>2</sub> discrepancy.</li>
   <li>Test-integrals from Genz's testsuite and several other well known
       and often used testfunctions.</li>
   <li>
     Several periodizing transformations as proposed by:
     <ul>
       <li>Sidi</li>
       <li>Laurie</li>
       <li>Sloan &amp; Joe</li>
     </ul>
   </li>
</ul>

<h2>Obtaining QMCPACK</h2>
<p>As the software is still in it's early stages, there is no official release
of QMCPACK yet.  However, people who are interested can always mail <a
